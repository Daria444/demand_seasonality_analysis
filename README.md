## algorithm_functions.ipynb 

A set of software functions of the algorithm for preparing data, calculating and visualizing descriptive statistics for a series of turnover dynamics, identifying pronounced seasonal deviations in demand dynamics, modeling demand dynamics and building a forecast, analyzing the correlation of turnover dynamics series, analyzing demand stability based on the distribution of goods into groups X, Y, Z, and clustering of series of dynamics of turnover.

## dash.py

Creating a dashboard using Python framework Dash. The dashboard demonstrates the result of the software algorithm for analyzing the seasonality of demand.

## dash_functions.py

A set of software functions for updating dashboard elements to analyze the seasonality of demand.
